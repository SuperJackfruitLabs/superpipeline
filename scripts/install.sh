#   BIN_DIR     where to install; default: ~/.local/bin
#
# Installs one binary under two names, `supi` and `superpipeline`, matching the `bin` entries in
# packages/cli/package.json: the full name for scripts and documentation a stranger reads, the
# short one for a person typing.
#
# Unlike agentpod's installer this sets up no service and enrolls nothing — supi is a client a
# person runs. It also never asks for sudo: a CLI that needs root to update itself is a CLI that
# stops updating itself, which is the drift this binary's `update` verb exists to prevent.
