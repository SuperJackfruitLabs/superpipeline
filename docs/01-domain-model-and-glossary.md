# 01 — Domain Model & Glossary

This document defines the **nouns** of Superpipeline and how they relate. Terminology here is
binding: code, APIs, and tests should use exactly these names.

## The three-level work hierarchy (read this first)

The single most important distinction in Superpipeline is **Card vs Task vs Run**. Conflating them
is the most likely source of design bugs.

- **Card** — the *durable unit of work* on the board (e.g. "Add OAuth login"). It persists for
  its whole life, moves across stages, has a human owner, and accumulates references and a
  full history. A card is long-lived and mutable (it advances stages).
- **Task** — *one unit of agent work on a card at a particular stage*, modeled on the **A2A
  `Task`**. A task is **immutable once terminal**: when a card advances to the next stage, or
  is reworked, a **new Task** is created under the same `contextId`. The card therefore owns a
  *sequence* of tasks over its lifetime (one or more per stage).
- **Run** *(a.k.a. Session)* — *one execution attempt of a Task by one agent*, modeled on
  Linear's **Agent Session** and Hermes's **task_run**. A task may be attempted multiple times
  (crash, reclaim, retry). A run owns the live activity stream and the heartbeat.

```
Card ──< Task (one per stage / rework, A2A-immutable) ──< Run (one per attempt) ──< Activity
  │                                                                                     
  └──< Reference (external link)        contextId groups all Tasks of one Card
```

> **Rule of thumb:** durable board state lives on the **Card**; the canonical state machine
> lives on the **Task**; ephemeral live progress lives on the **Run**.

> **⚠️ Task is not implemented — read this before designing against it.** The above is the intended
> model. In the code there is **no `tasks` table** and no `task_` id is ever minted: the Board DO
> stores `cards`, `runs`, `activities`, `gates`, `elicitations`, `card_references`, and the **A2A
> `state` lives directly on the card row**. So today the hierarchy is two levels, not three:
>
> ```
> Card (carries the A2A state) ──< Run (one per attempt) ──< Activity
> ```
>
> Everywhere the specs say "the Task's state", the shipped system means `card.state`; where they say
> "advancing a stage creates a new Task", the card's stage and state are updated in place and the
> history is the ordered `runs` + `activities`. The A2A immutability property that a new Task would
> give us is therefore **not** enforced. `contextId` exists on the card. Introducing a real Task
> record is design intent, and it is the single largest gap between [01](./01-domain-model-and-glossary.md)/[03](./03-card-lifecycle.md)
> and the code.

## Entities

### Tenant *(a.k.a. Workspace)*
superpipeline's **local hard isolation boundary** — and only that. All data, auth, and agent
registrations are scoped to exactly one tenant. Fields: `id`, `slug`, `name`, `createdAt`,
`externalId`, `externalSource`, settings, billing. There is no cross-tenant read path;
isolation is enforced at the edge, not by a query filter.

**It is deliberately not an Org.** Principal, Team, Role and authority belong to the
Organization plane, which does not exist yet; a product that grows its own org model has to
migrate it later. So superpipeline owns the boundary and nothing about who anyone *is*.

**The external mapping.** `externalSource` names the system a tenant is also known to
(`agentpod` today, `org-plane` later) and `externalId` is that system's id, kept opaque
because it is not superpipeline's id space. **Both or neither**, enforced by a database CHECK
(`tenants_external_pair`) — an id recorded without the system it came from cannot be joined
against anything, and a wrong join is harder to notice than a missing one. AgentPod carries
the same pair with the same CHECK on its own rows.

Absent is the normal, complete state: a **standalone superpipeline** — a plain kanban board for
someone's agents, with no organisation layer anywhere — never sets either column. When the
Organization plane mints canonical ids, both products map to them: a data move, not a schema
change. The mapping is deliberately **not unique** — superpipeline is one-tenant-per-user, so two
people in one real organisation legitimately map two local boundaries onto one external id.
A shared mapping never becomes a shared keyspace; isolation stays local, on `tenantId`.

### User & Membership
A human principal and their role within a tenant. `Membership(userId, tenantId, role)` where
`role ∈ {owner, admin, member, viewer}`, ids prefixed `mbr_`.

Humans authenticate with **GitHub OAuth → a signed session cookie** (`superpipeline_session`, HMAC over
`SESSION_SECRET`, 30 days, stateless — there is no session store). Signing in creates a personal
workspace with the user as `owner`. **⚠️ There is no magic-link and no email sending anywhere in the
repo** — earlier drafts listed it as a login method; it was never built. GitHub is the only provider.

**`role` is enforced.** Since 2026-09-02 every route resolves the caller's role and refuses what it
does not permit: `viewer` reads, `member` works the board, `admin` manages boards and agents,
`owner` manages people and the fleet link. A caller with **no** membership is refused outright
rather than demoted to a reader. Roles are read per request, so removing someone takes effect on
their next call rather than their next sign-in.

An agent token's `scopes` are enforced too, with one deliberate exception: a `claim` scope
grandfathers `run`, because a claim an agent cannot finish is worse than no check at all — the card
is taken and abandoned mid-flight.

**This `role` is a *seat*, not a *post*.** It says what an account may do inside this workspace. It
is **not** the Organization plane's Role, which describes a job — responsibilities, required
capabilities, authority, evaluation criteria — and does not exist yet. The two are never unified
and one is never inferred from the other; see
`charter → decisions/2026-09-03-role-is-a-seat-and-a-post.md`. A workspace that had to ask another
plane whether you may edit a card would no longer be a kanban board that stands alone.

### Agent *(registered worker)*
An external worker registered to a tenant. It is an **app-actor identity** (per Linear's
`actor=app`), *not* a human user, and is always badged as an agent in the UI. Fields on the
`agents` row:
- `id` (`agt_`), `tenantId`, `name`, `iconUrl`
- `capabilities` — the work-capability tags it can service (e.g. `research`, `code`, `security`);
  the whole of what routing compares. **⚠️ The word means three different things across the suite**,
  and only the first is this one:
  | sense | answers | lives in |
  |---|---|---|
  | **skill** | what an agent is good at — routing and discovery | *this field*; A2A `AgentSkill`; OASF |
  | **affordance** | what an agent can invoke | MCP tools, OpenAPI operations, AgentPod's station capabilities (`acp`, `fs.write`, `terminal`) |
  | **authority** | what an agent may *do* | `mayDispatch` / `mayGrantReach` in a hub token |

  Matching a grant on a skill tag, or reading an AgentPod station capability as one of these, was
  refused deliberately — see `charter → decisions/2026-09-02-capability-is-three-words.md`. Note
  superpipeline's own `members.ts` also declares an unrelated `type Capability = 'read' | 'work' |
  'manage' | 'own'`; that is a permission verb, and a fourth use of the word inside one repository.
- `tokens` — per-agent `spa_` bearer credentials, stored as SHA-256 hashes, carrying `scopes`
  (**recorded, never enforced**)
- `concurrency` — the operator's ceiling on simultaneous claimed cards. An agent may ask for
  *less* at claim time; never more. **⚠️ Counted per board**, because the count lives in the board's
  Durable Object — an agent at its ceiling on one board can still claim on another.

**`status` and `connection` were dropped** in migration 0005 (2026-09-02). Neither was ever
written: every agent read `'offline'` from the day it was created, including while it held a live
lease, and REST is the only transport an agent has ever had. Liveness is knowable from `runs` in
the board DO, which is where a claim actually happens.

**An AgentCard is served, as a projection.** `GET /v1/agents/:id/card` renders the agent's
capabilities as A2A `AgentSkill` entries read from the capability registry — a projection of those
rows rather than a translation of them, which is why the registry's columns carry A2A's field
names. A capability the registry has no row for still appears, degraded to its key: a card that
omitted a tag the agent routes on would disagree with the claim predicate.

### Board
A named workspace surface within a tenant containing one pipeline and its cards. Fields:
`id`, `tenantId`, `name`, `pipelineId`, `createdAt`. **One Board = one Durable Object** (see
[Architecture](./02-architecture.md)).

### Pipeline & Stage *(column)*
A **Pipeline** is the ordered list of **Stages** a card flows through. Each **Stage** (rendered
as a board column) declares:
- `key`, `name`, `order`
- `owner` — which agents work this stage: a **capability tag** (e.g. `code`) or a specific
  `agentId`, or `human` (no agent; human-only column)
- `requires` — a multi-capability requirement, when one tag is not enough: `{all: [...]}` (the agent
  must hold every member) or `{any: [...]}` (at least one), and both may be present. Wins over
  `owner` when set. It is a **sibling** of `owner` rather than a widening of it, so a board written
  before it existed reads back unchanged — and because SQLite's `json_each` raises on a scalar,
  making `owner` itself a union would have broken the registry's `boardCount` on every existing
  stage
- `gate` — `none | approval` (an `approval` stage requires a human ✅ before the card advances)
- `wipLimit` — max cards concurrently in this stage (the real Kanban constraint)
- `entry`/`exit` hints — optional structured-handoff requirements (e.g. "a PR reference must
  be attached before exit"). **⚠️ OPEN**: how rich stage entry/exit conditions should be in v1.

### Card
The durable unit of work. Fields:
- `id`, `boardId`, `tenantId`, `title`, `spec` (opaque JSON input — domain-agnostic)
- `ownerUserId` — the accountable **human owner** (never an agent)
- `currentStageKey`, `priority`, `labels`
- `delegateAgentId` — the agent currently executing (the *delegate*; nullable)
- `references[]` — external links (see below)
- `currentTaskId` — the active A2A Task, if any
- timestamps, `archivedAt`

### Task *(A2A-aligned)* — **⚠️ not implemented**
The intended unit of agent work on a card at a stage; see the warning at the top of this document.
No `tasks` table exists, so the fields below describe the design, not a record you can read:
- `id`, `cardId`, `contextId` (shared across all tasks of the card), `stageKey`
- `state` — the A2A `TaskState` (see [Card Lifecycle](./03-card-lifecycle.md))
- `artifacts[]` — outputs produced (A2A `Artifact`; may reference R2 blobs)
- `history[]` — A2A `Message`s (the durable conversational record)
- `metadata` — structured handoff payload for the next stage (Hermes-style)
- timestamps, terminal-ness

### Run *(Session / attempt)*
One attempt to execute a card's stage work. **A run belongs to the agent that claimed it** — every
run verb and the run read compare the caller against `run.agentId` and refuse a mismatch with
`403 NOT_RUN_OWNER`, distinct from the `409 STALE_LEASE` that means "your lease lapsed, re-claim".
Fields (Linear Session × Hermes task_run; `taskId` is `cardId` in practice, there being no Task):
- `id` (`run_`), `cardId`, `agentId`, `stageKey`, `leaseEpoch`, `startedAt`, `endedAt`
- `outcome` — `completed | blocked | rejected | crashed | timed_out | reclaimed | canceled`
- `lastHeartbeatAt`, `workerRef` (opaque agent-side identifier)
- `activities[]` — the typed activity stream

### Activity
A typed, append-only progress event emitted by an agent (or human) onto a Run. Types (Linear
verbatim): `thought | action | response | elicitation | error` (plus `prompt` = human input).
`thought`/`action` may be **ephemeral** (rendered transiently, replaced by the next activity).
Fields: `id`, `runId`, `type`, `body`/`action`/`parameter`/`result`, `ephemeral`, `signal?`,
`usage?`, `createdAt`. Activities are **immutable snapshots** — the source of truth agents read
back from (never read mutable card fields mid-run).

There is **no `signalMetadata`** — a signal's structured payload rides in **`parameter`**, and the
second carrier was removed in #36 because nothing read it (a test pins its absence). Note also that
state is derived from activity only for `elicitation`; `response` and `error` do **not** move the
card — see the warning in [04 §4](./04-agent-contract.md).

### Signal
Optional typed metadata attached to an activity that tells the recipient how to interpret/
render it. Initial set (Linear): `stop` (human→agent: halt now), `auth` (agent→human: link an
account/credential), `select` (agent→human: choose from options — **this is how an approval
gate renders Approve / Request changes / Reject**). The coded enum is
`stop | auth | select | approve | reject`. The payload rides in the activity's **`parameter`** —
`{ "options": [{ "name", "title" }] }` for `select` — and that is the **only** carrier.

### Gate / Approval
A pause where a human decision is required before a card advances. Realized as a card in state
`input-required` carrying a `select` signal, with a `gate_` row recording the decision. A human
resolves it at `POST /v1/boards/:boardId/gates/:gateId/resolve` (approve → advance; request changes
→ back to the agent with feedback; reject → terminal `rejected`). The producer cannot resolve their
own gate (`403 SEPARATION_OF_DUTIES`). See [Card Lifecycle](./03-card-lifecycle.md).

### Elicitation *(an answerable question)*
A question an agent asked, persisted so it can be **answered** — the activity stream is append-only
history, and history cannot be replied to. Fields: `id` (`elc_`), `cardId`, `runId`, `stageKey`,
`agentId` (who asked), `question`, `signal`, `options[]` (`{name, title, promptFill?, interactive?}`),
`status` (`pending | answered | cancelled`), `answer` (`{option, text, answeredBy, answeredAt}` or
`null`), `createdAt`.

- **Raised** by posting an `elicitation` activity; the options ride in the activity's `parameter`.
  The card parks in `input-required` (or `auth-required` for an `auth` signal) and **the asking run
  keeps its lease** — the agent is waiting, not finished.
- **Answered** by a signed-in human at `POST /v1/boards/:boardId/elicitations/:elicitationId/answer`.
  This is deliberately not an agent route, and the board separately refuses an answer from the agent
  that asked (`403 SEPARATION_OF_DUTIES`). Answering twice is `409 ELICITATION_NOT_PENDING`.
- **Collected** by the asking agent re-reading the run it already holds
  (`GET /v1/boards/:boardId/runs/:runId` → `elicitations[]`) — no human credential and no second
  authorization rule. Only one question per card can be pending: a new one supersedes the old, and a
  question whose run ends or whose card moves on becomes `cancelled`.

Full path and semantics in [04 §4](./04-agent-contract.md).

### Reference *(external link / attachment)*
A first-class link from a card to an external resource. Modeled on Linear's idempotent
attachments. Fields: `id`, `cardId`, `url` (**dedup key** within a card), `title`, `subtitle`,
`provider` (`github | gitlab | docs | url | …`), `sourceType`
(`issue | pull_request | repo | branch | commit | doc | url`), `externalId` (e.g. GitHub
`node_id` or `owner/repo#n`), `metadata` (JSON: state, merged, draft, refs…), `syncState`
(`synced | stale | error`), `lastSyncedAt`. Upsert is idempotent on `(cardId, url)`. Detailed
in [06 — External References](./06-external-references.md).

### Event
The append-only audit + realtime feed for a board. Every meaningful change (card created,
stage advanced, agent claimed, activity emitted, gate resolved, reference added) is an Event.
Events drive the WebSocket broadcast to UI clients and the webhook dispatch to subscribers.

## Glossary (quick reference)

| Term | One-line meaning |
|------|------------------|
| **Tenant / Workspace** | superpipeline's *local* hard isolation boundary; everything is scoped to one. Not an authority — the Organization plane owns Principal/Team/Role |
| **External mapping** | Optional `externalSource` + `externalId` on a tenant: the same real organisation, as known to another system. Both or neither |
| **Board** | A pipeline + its cards; one Durable Object |
| **Pipeline / Stage** | The ordered columns a card flows through |
| **Card** | The durable unit of work; has a human owner |
| **Task** | A2A-style unit of agent work on a card at a stage; immutable when terminal. **⚠️ Not implemented — the state lives on the Card** |
| **Run / Session** | One attempt to execute a card's stage work by one agent; owned by that agent (`403 NOT_RUN_OWNER` for anyone else) |
| **Elicitation** | A question an agent asked, with its options and its answer; answered by a human, collected off the run |
| **contextId** | Groups all Tasks belonging to one Card (A2A) |
| **delegate** | The agent currently executing a card (never the owner) |
| **owner** | The accountable human for a card |
| **Activity** | Typed append-only progress event (thought/action/response/elicitation/error) |
| **Signal** | Typed overlay on an activity (stop/auth/select/approve/reject) |
| **Gate** | Human-approval pause; a Task in `input-required` |
| **Reference** | First-class external link (GitHub issue/PR, repo, doc) |
| **AgentCard** | A2A capability/discovery document for an agent |
| **Seat** | What an account may do inside one plane — superpipeline's `memberships.role`. Local, never unified with another plane's, never inferred from a post |
| **Post** | What a principal is *for*: duties, required capabilities, authority, how it is judged. The Organization plane's Role. **Does not exist yet** |
| **Capability tag** | The `key` of a Capability — the string a stage and an agent both carry, and the whole of what routing compares |
| **Capability** | A record in the workspace registry (migration 0006), shaped as an A2A `AgentSkill`: `key`, `name`, `description`, `tags`, `examples`, plus an optional external mapping (an OASF dotted id, say). It gives a routing tag an identity and a definition; it does not enumerate what may exist |
| **Requirement** | A stage's `requires`: `{all}` / `{any}` over capability tags, when one is not enough. Matching stays exact string equality on every member |
| **Implication** | A workspace declaring that holding one capability means holding another (`code-review` implies `code`). An agent's **declared** set expands to an **effective** set over these edges, and only the effective set is matched at claim |
| **Structured handoff** | The `metadata` an agent passes to the next stage |
| **Event** | Append-only audit record + realtime/webhook feed item |
