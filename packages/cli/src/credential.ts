/**
 * The credential `supi` acts with.
 *
 * A **hub-issued token** — the same one `apn fleet login` produces. superpipeline verifies it offline
 * against the hub's JWKS, so one sign-in serves both planes; that is what
 * `charter → decisions/2026-08-15-one-issuer-and-offline-verification.md` is for.
 *
 * Resolution order, and nothing else is ever consulted:
 *
 *   1. `$SUPERPIPELINE_TOKEN` — this CLI's own, for a caller that wants them separate
 *   2. `$AGENTPOD_TOKEN` — the hub token, because it IS the credential superpipeline accepts
 *   3. the file `apn fleet login` writes
 *
 * **It never reads a `kbn_` agent token.** Those name an agent, and an agent is not a person
 * operating a board: it claims work through the MCP server or the REST verbs with its own
 * identity. A CLI that silently acted as an agent would attribute a human's decisions to one,
 * which is the distinction `charter → decisions/2026-08-13-ecosystem-identity.md` Decision 2
 * exists to protect — when a human acts, the human is the actor.
