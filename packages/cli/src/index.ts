/**
 * `supi` — superpipeline from a terminal.
 *
 * Installed under two names, `superpipeline` and `supi`, pointing at this one file: the full
 * name for scripts and documentation a stranger reads, the short one for a person typing.
 * It was `kbn` until the product was renamed; that name was short for the old one.
 *
 * The third consumer of `@superpipeline/contract`, after REST and MCP. It is a client: it adds no
 * authority, performs no local permission check, and renders the board's own refusals. A client
 * that pre-empts a server decision is a client that will one day disagree with it.
 *
 * The verbs here are **work** verbs, because a hub token resolves as a `member` — see README.md
 * for why that is a decision rather than a limitation, and what it would take to change.

  supi boards                  the workspace's boards
  supi board <boardId>         one board: its stages and their cards
  supi card <boardId> <cardId> one card in full
  supi move <boardId> <cardId> <stageKey>
                               move a card to another stage
  supi gates <boardId>         approval gates waiting on a human

Credential: $${ENV_TOKEN}, else $AGENTPOD_TOKEN, else the token \`apn fleet login\` writes.
One sign-in serves both planes — superpipeline verifies the hub's token offline.

Not here: creating boards, staffing agents, editing capabilities, changing the fleet link.
Those need a seat in the workspace, which a hub token does not grant. See README.md.`;
