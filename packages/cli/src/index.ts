/**
 * `supi` — superpipeline from a terminal.
 *
 * Installed under two names, `superpipeline` and `supi`, pointing at this one file: the full
 * name for scripts and documentation a stranger reads, the short one for a person typing.
 * It was `kbn` until the product was renamed; that name was short for the old one.
 *
 * The third consumer of `@superpipeline/contract`, after REST and MCP. It is a client: it adds no
 * authority, performs no local permission check, and renders the board's own refusals. A client
 * that pre-empts a server decision is a client that will one day disagree with it.
 *
 * **The verbs used to be work verbs only, and the reason given for that is no longer true.**
 * The text here said a hub token "resolves as a `member`", so managing anything needed a seat
 * the token did not grant. That was accurate until 2026-09-20, when superpipeline learned to map an
 * issuer subject onto a local user (`apps/api/src/auth/hub-oauth.ts`): a mapped principal reads
 * its real membership, and for the person who owns the workspace that is `owner`. The seat was
 * never withheld from the CLI — it did not exist yet.
 *
 * So `create-board` is here. It is still a client: it adds no authority, performs no local
 * permission check, and renders the board's own refusals. A caller with no seat gets a 403 from
 * the server, which is where that decision belongs — a client that pre-empts a server decision
 * is a client that will one day disagree with it, and this file spent a release disagreeing.

const USAGE = `supi — superpipeline from a terminal (\`superpipeline\` is the same command)

  supi whoami                  who the stored token says you are
  supi boards                  the workspace's boards
  supi board <boardId>         one board: its stages and their cards
  supi card <boardId> <cardId> one card in full
  supi move <boardId> <cardId> <stageKey>
                               move a card to another stage
  supi gates <boardId>         approval gates waiting on a human

  supi create-board <name> [--template <id>] [--stages <file|->]
                               create a board; --template defaults to \`simple\`
  supi set-stages <boardId> <file|->
                               replace a board's pipeline
  supi create-card <boardId> <title> [--spec <file|->] [--priority <n>]
                               queue a card, with this token as its grant
  supi templates               the starting pipelines --template accepts

  supi agents                  the workspace's agents and what they declare
  supi capabilities            the capability registry, with each one's origin
  supi implications            what one capability implies about another

  supi update [--check]        replace this binary with the newest release
  supi version                 print this binary's version

  --json                       machine-stable output, on any command

Credential: $${ENV_TOKEN}, else $AGENTPOD_TOKEN, else the token \`fleet login\` writes.
Expired file tokens renew through the device credential from fleet login.
Explicit environment tokens are used as supplied; superpipeline verifies them offline.

Not here: staffing agents, editing capabilities, changing the fleet link.
What you may do is your seat in the workspace, which the server decides — not this
command. A refusal comes back as a 403 and is printed as it arrives.`;
