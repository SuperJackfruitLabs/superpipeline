 * `tnt` is registered to superpipeline as `declared-and-minted` in the shared fixture corpus
 * (AgentPod `fixtures/ecosystem-identity/id_grammar.json`), with accept/reject cases another
 * repo's suite asserts against; renaming would be a coordinated two-repo change that buys no
 * correctness. Collision safety comes from the registry, not from the spelling: AgentPod's own
 * local boundary must claim a *different* prefix, exactly as `run_`/`attempt_` was settled — the
 * side with no rows moves, and here that is AgentPod's, which does not exist yet.
