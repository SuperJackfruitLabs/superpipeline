/**
 * The one spelling of a work-capability tag.
 *
 * A capability is how superpipeline routes a card to an agent, and the whole of the match is
 * `agent.capabilities.includes(stage.owner)` — exact string equality between two free strings.
 * Nothing defines the set, so every place that produces one had invented its own spelling: board
 * templates slugified a stage name (`code-review`), the agent editor lowercased it
 * (`code review`), and the create route normalised nothing at all. Three spellings of one word,
 * compared by equality, matching nothing.
 *
 * This is a normaliser, NOT the capability registry the charter's Capabilities layer calls for
 * (`strategy/2026-08-12-layer-reference.md`, P1/P3, nouns `Capability, Provider`). That registry
 * would say which capabilities EXIST and what they mean; this only guarantees that two people
 * typing the same words produce the same tag. It belongs in the contract because it is the one
 * thing both the Worker and the board UI must agree on, and a normaliser each side implements
 * separately is the bug it exists to prevent.
 *
 * Work capabilities are also NOT AgentPod's station capabilities — `acp`, `fs.read`, `terminal`
 * are protocol capabilities, and matching a grant on either was rejected as "the same word, two
 * vocabularies" (charter decisions/2026-08-15-a-grant-names-an-agent-per-plane.md).
