   * Answer an agent's question (docs/04 §4) — the human half of the elicitation return path.
   *
   * Authorization has two halves and both matter. The **edge** only exposes this to a human
   * principal (a session; agent tokens reach `claims` and `runs/*` and nothing else). Here, where
   * every surface must pass, the **asking agent is refused by identity**: an elicitation an agent
   * can answer itself is decorative, and this is the same separation-of-duties rule `resolveGate`
   * already enforces for the producer of a gate.
   *
   * The card moves through the **state machine's own** transition — `human_reply` out of
   * `input-required`, `account_linked` out of `auth-required` — rather than a second, parallel
   * path: if the contract stops allowing it, this stops doing it.
   *
   * Answering a settled question is a typed conflict, never a second transition, so a double-click
   * (or a retried delivery) cannot move a card twice.
