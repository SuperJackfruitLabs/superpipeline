/**
 * Matching a grant value against the principal a dispatch would run as.
 *
 * The rule is the fixture's, not ours: `fixtures/ecosystem-identity/token_claims.json` in
 * AgentPod pins it, and this is superpipeline's hand-written implementation of the same contract —
 * duplicated in behaviour and shared in specification, which is the arrangement that has kept
 * five hand-written Go mirrors honest.
 *
 * A grant now names one principal id and matches by EQUALITY — no per-plane namespace, no
 * wildcard. The `superpipeline:` prefix and `*` suffix this file used to implement were DELETED, not
 * deprecated: `hermes:*` silently spanned nodes, and a namespaced wildcard grant once reached a
 * root station that should never have existed. A pattern matches things nobody intended; an
 * enumeration cannot.

 * Does one grant value permit this principal?

 * never equal a real `prn_…` id, so it simply fails to match rather than being read as "every
 * principal" or "every principal of this shape". A value from a retired or foreign scheme (a
 * `superpipeline:`-namespaced id, say) is not special-cased either: it is just a string, and it is not
 * equal to the id being checked, which is the same "ignore, never deny" outcome the fixture
 * requires without any namespace grammar to check it against.

 * which no external grant can ever name. `null` means this local agent has never been linked to
 * a principal (the ordinary state for a standalone superpipeline, and for every agent before someone
 * records a mapping): no grant, however it reads, can cover an id that does not exist yet.
 *
 * `null` for `grant` is "no grant was recorded", which is not the same as an empty one and is
 * refused just the same: nobody with authority ever asked for this work to run. An empty array
