/**
 * What a `spa_` token is allowed to do.
 *
 * Scopes have been minted onto every agent token since migration 0001 (`scopes_json`), returned by
 * the resolver, and compared to nothing: a token minted with `['claim']` drove every run verb and
 * every MCP tool. An authorization field that is recorded and never checked reads as protection
 * that does not exist, which is worse than no field, so this is where the comparison lives.
 *
 * Two scopes, because there are two things an agent does:
 *
 * - `claim` — take a card off the board (`POST …/claims`).
 * - `run`   — drive a claimed card (`GET/POST …/runs/*`) and the MCP tools that wrap those verbs.
 *
 * **`claim` grandfathers `run`, deliberately.** Every token minted before this file existed holds
 * `['claim']` alone, and those agents are running now. Enforcing the split literally would let
 * them claim a card and then be refused every verb that finishes it — a card taken and abandoned
 * mid-flight, which is strictly worse for the board than the unchecked scope was. A claim an agent
 * cannot complete is not a safer claim. New tokens carry both explicitly, so the grandfather
 * clause ages out on its own as tokens are reissued.
