/**
 * Walking through the hub's front door from a domain its cookie will never reach.
 *
 * superpipeline runs on `superpipeline.dev`; the hub's session cookie is `Domain=.agentpod.dev`,
 * `SameSite=Lax`. Those are different registrable domains, so the browser never attaches that
 * cookie to a cross-site `fetch` — which is why `hubToken()`'s direct call to
 * `GET /api/auth/token` has returned nothing in production since the day it was written, and why
 * every card queued from the deployed UI has carried no authority, silently.
 *
 * What Lax still permits is **top-level navigation**. So the browser *goes* to the hub instead of
 * *calling* it, the hub reads its own first-party cookie, and a one-time code rides back here in
 * the redirect. See agentpod's
 * `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-02-cross-domain-token-handoff-design.md`.
 *
 * Three routes, one job each:
 *
 *   POST /hub/connect   mint a PKCE verifier + state, keep them HttpOnly, answer with the hub
 *                       authorize URL for the page to navigate to.
 *   GET  /hub/callback  the hub's redirect lands here: check `state`, spend the code for a token
 *                       server-to-server, verify it, sign the person in, and hand it on.
 *   GET  /hub/token     the SPA reads the token it was handed, and learns whether this
 *                       deployment has a hub at all. Same-origin, this Worker's own cookie — no
 *                       hub cookie involved.
 *
 * **The verifier is minted here and never leaves this Worker.** The design sketch had the page
 * generate it into `sessionStorage`, which cannot work: the exchange is server-to-server (the hub
 * refuses any exchange request carrying an `Origin` header, and strips its CORS headers off that
 * response so a page could not read the answer anyway), so the verifier has to be somewhere this
 * Worker can read at callback time. An HttpOnly cookie is that somewhere, and it is strictly
 * better than `sessionStorage`: a code read out of an address bar, a history entry or a `Referer`
 * is then worth nothing to anyone but this Worker, even to script running on this origin.
 *
 * **Nothing here is mandatory.** `HUB_ISSUER` unset means a standalone superpipeline, and every route
 * below answers 503 without reaching for anything — the same posture the rest of the hub-token
 * path takes (`env.ts`, migration 0003). A board with no hub keeps working exactly as it did.
