/**
 * Verifying a token issued by the hub, at the edge, without asking anyone.
 *
 * charter decisions/2026-08-15-one-issuer-and-offline-verification.md: one
 * issuer, and every other plane verifies offline against a published JWKS.
 * decisions/2026-08-13-ecosystem-identity.md is where the shape comes from —
 * enforcement local, the token as carrier, and explicitly **not** a
 * policy-service call in the hot path.
 *
 * So the JWKS is fetched once and cached, and a verify that finds the key it
 * needs makes no network call at all. Two consequences follow, and both are
 * deliberate:
 *
 *   - An issuer outage degrades new sign-ins, not work in flight. Proved by
 *     running it (agentpod#331): a Worker verified a token with the issuer
 *     process killed.
 *   - Retiring a signing key does NOT take effect here until this cache
 *     expires. Key deletion is not an emergency revocation lever, and the same
 *     issue measured the lag.
 *
 * That second point is deliberately one-directional. A key ADDED to the
 * published set is picked up right away: a token naming a `kid` this cache
 * has not seen triggers exactly one refetch before rejecting (see `keySet`
 * below). Without that, rotation would be safe to perform but unsafe to rely
 * on for up to `JWKS_TTL_MS` afterwards — the one case where that lag bites is
 * a suspected key compromise, exactly when you need the new key trusted
 * immediately, not in ten minutes. A key REMOVED from the set is a different
 * story: its `kid` is still in our cache, so nothing here notices until the
 * TTL turns over, which is why revocation-via-deletion still is not an
 * emergency lever.
