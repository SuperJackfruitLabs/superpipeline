/**
 * Resolve a human from a token issued by the suite's hub, verified offline.
 *
 * Deliberately a SEPARATE function rather than another branch inside
 * `resolveUser`, so the hub-token path is one readable thing rather than a
 * condition buried in the session path.
 *
 * **Corrected 2026-08-30.** This comment used to say "this is the first
 * endpoint to accept a hub token, and keeping the seam narrow means the blast
 * radius of getting it wrong is one route instead of the whole surface." That
 * stopped being true: `index.ts` calls this for every human route (and, for
 * GET, on the board-list path above it). The widening happened; the comment
 * did not. Read as written it would tell a reviewer that approving a gate with
 * a hub token needs new wiring, when in fact it already worked — which is
 * exactly the kind of drift `charter`'s README warns about, a claim about code
 * kept somewhere the code cannot contradict it.
 *
 * Three refusals worth naming, because all three fail closed:
 *
 *   - **No issuer configured** → no hub-token path at all. A standalone board
 *     must work with no issuer anywhere, and an unset issuer must never mean
 *     "trust any issuer".
 *   - **A verified token whose tenant maps to nothing here** → refused. The
 *     claim names AgentPod's boundary (`fleet_…`); ours is `tnt_…`, and neither
 *     product mints the other's ids. With no mapping there is no tenant to act
 *     in, and falling back to a default would hand one board's data to a token
 *     that never named it.
 *   - **A verified token whose `principalKind` is not `"human"`** → refused. Since
 *     `charter → decisions/2026-08-30-an-agent-is-a-principal.md` a node can exchange its own
 *     credential for a token naming a station's agent principal, so "a valid hub token" and
 *     "a person" stopped being the same thing. `resolveHubAgent` refuses the converse for the
 *     same reason and says so in the same words: one plane's credential must not double as the
 *     other kind just because it verifies.

 * principal id and whose `principalKind` is `"agent"` (charter
 * decisions/2026-08-30-an-agent-is-a-principal.md), and superpipeline must accept it AS THAT AGENT.
 *
 * **Capabilities never come from the claim.** They are superpipeline's own vocabulary — charter
 * decisions/2026-08-15-a-grant-names-an-agent-per-plane.md calls putting them in a cross-plane
 * claim "a trap — the same word, two vocabularies". The token names a principal (`sub`);
 * `findAgentByExternal` looks up superpipeline's OWN `agents` row for that principal and its
 * capabilities come from there, never from the token.
 *
 * Four refusals, all failing closed, same posture as `resolveHubUser`:
 *
 *   - **No issuer configured** → no hub-token path at all. A standalone board works with no
 *     issuer anywhere.
 *   - **A `sub` that maps to no local agent** → refused, not admitted with a null agent. There is
 *     no capability set to act with.
 *   - **`principalKind` is not `"agent"`** → refused. A human's token must never double as an
 *     agent credential just because its `sub` happens to also be mapped as one.
 *   - **The claim's `tenant` does not map to the SAME superpipeline tenant the agent row names** →
 *     refused. `resolveHubUser` already maps `claims.tenant` through `findTenantByExternal` and
 *     refuses an unmapped one; this mirrors that rather than trusting the agent row alone, so a
 *     token minted for one fleet cannot resolve into an agent whose row happens to sit in a
 *     different superpipeline tenant. charter → decisions/2026-08-15-tenancy-is-local-and-mapped.md:
 *     an unmapped tenant is "invisible to the other plane, and silently so" — the check makes
 *     that invisibility a refusal instead of a silent cross-tenant hop.
