/**
 * Superpipeline API — the edge Worker (docs/02-architecture.md). It authenticates, resolves the tenant,
 * and routes board requests to the per-(tenant, board) Board Durable Object, serving the SvelteKit
 * SPA same-origin for everything else.
 *
 * Auth (docs/05 §3). Three principals, resolved before dispatch:
 *   - humans      — a signed `superpipeline_session` cookie from GitHub OAuth (auth/routes.ts). Stateless
 *                   HMAC, no session store. This is what board/card administration requires.
 *   - agents      — a `spa_` bearer on the agent routes only: `…/claims` and `…/runs/*`. The tenant
 *                   AND the agent identity come from the token, never from the request.
 *   - dev headers — `X-Tenant-Id`/`X-Agent-Id`/`?tenant=` are a full credential, so they are gated
 *                   on DEV_AUTH === 'true' and are absent from wrangler.jsonc by design. A deploy
 *                   rejects them. (An earlier version of this comment described them as the primary
 *                   mechanism awaiting "OAuth/magic-link"; real login shipped, and no magic-link was
 *                   ever built.)
 *
 * Both recorded permissions are now checked, where before neither was:
 *   - token `scopes` on the agent routes (auth/scopes.ts) — `claim` to take a card, `run` to drive
 *     one, with `claim` grandfathering `run` for tokens minted before the split.
 *   - `memberships.role` on every human route (db/members.ts) — viewer reads, member works the
 *     board, admin manages boards and agents, owner manages people and the fleet link. A caller
 *     with no membership is refused rather than demoted to a reader.
