/**
 * An agent's A2A AgentCard, projected from the registry.
 *
 * This is what naming 0006's columns after `AgentSkill` was FOR. `docs/01` already calls AgentCard
 * an agent's capability document, and the charter's layer reference says a capability registry
 * "does not invent a replacement for MCP/OpenAPI/CLI/A2A" — so the card is a projection of these
 * rows, not a translation of them. Nothing is renamed on the way out.
 *
 * **A capability the agent holds that the registry has never seen still appears**, degraded to its
 * key. The card describes the agent, and an agent that routes on a tag whose card omits it would
 * be a card that disagrees with the routing — which is the class of silent mismatch this whole
 * area exists to end. A missing row is a registry gap, not a reason to lie about the agent.
