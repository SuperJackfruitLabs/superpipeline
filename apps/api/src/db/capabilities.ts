 * invented its own vocabulary and almost nothing matched. This is where a capability gets an
 * identity, a definition and a provenance.
 *
 * **It does not enumerate what may exist.** Four of the five reference agent registries — MCP,
 * A2A, Entra, NANDA — deliberately decline to define a vocabulary and standardise the record
 * instead; only AGNTCY/OASF ships a taxonomy, and even that is extensible. A closed list would be
 * a migration every time somebody adds a stage.
 *
 * The shape is A2A's `AgentSkill` (`id, name, description, tags, examples`), so a future
 * AgentCard is a projection of these rows rather than a translation of them, and the optional
 * `externalId`/`externalSource` pair is how one is ALSO known in OASF — the same borrowing
 * pattern `tenants` and `agents` already use, with the same all-or-nothing rule.

/**
 * Every capability this workspace knows, alphabetically, each with who refers to it.

 * an agent that can claim nothing — the exact bug that shipped, where thirteen agents carried
 * `claim` (a token scope) and matched no lane in any board. A capability named by a stage and
 * held by no agent is a lane no one can work. Both are invisible until something counts them.
 *
 * Correlated subqueries rather than joins: an agent holding three capabilities must not multiply
 * this list into three rows.
 *
 * `boardCount` counts a stage that names the capability **any way a stage can** — as `owner`, or
 * as a member of either arm of `requires`. Missing that second case is not a cosmetic bug: a
 * capability required only by a set-valued lane would count zero boards and be reported as an
 * orphan, by the very diagnostic built to find the original mismatch.
 *
 * `json_each` over the `$.requires.*` paths is safe on legacy rows precisely because they are
 * ABSENT there — `json_each` returns no rows for a missing path, but raises `malformed JSON` for
 * a scalar. That asymmetry is why `requires` is a sibling of `owner` rather than a union with it.
