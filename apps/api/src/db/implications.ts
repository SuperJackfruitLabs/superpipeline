/**
 * What one capability implies about another (migration 0007).
 *
 * Routing is exact string equality, deliberately — when a card does not move, the diagnosis must
 * stay a comparison anyone can run by hand, and a similarity score would make that same failure
 * unfalsifiable. But equality alone cannot say that `code-review` is a kind of `code`, so renaming
 * a lane strands every agent staffed for the old tag, and an agent that can plainly do the work is
 * refused for having spelled its competence one level down.
 *
 * These are edges, not a hierarchy: no root, no depth limit, no single tree. A capability may
 * imply several and be implied by several.
 *
 * **Declared vs effective.** An agent's DECLARED set is what an operator typed. Its EFFECTIVE set
 * is the transitive closure over these edges, and that is what routing matches on. The two must
 * both be visible wherever an operator reasons about staffing — a diagnostic counting effective
 * holders while showing declared ones is a diagnostic that lies.
