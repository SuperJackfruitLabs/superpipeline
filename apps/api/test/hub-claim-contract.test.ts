/**
 * The claim NAMES superpipeline depends on, pinned here so a rename upstream fails a test.
 *
 * agentpod's `fixtures/ecosystem-identity/token_claims.json` is the contract, and its own
 * `purpose` field says why it exists: "The moment a second plane reads a claim, the claim's NAME
 * is a contract: a rename in the hub is a silent authorization failure in superpipeline, which
 * fails in the direction that looks like the caller having no permission."
 *
 * superpipeline is that second plane, and until this file the fixture reached it only as prose in
 * comments — no copy, no test, no cross-repo CI step. A rename touching agentpod's code, fixture
 * and tests would have been green in both repositories and a silent 403 in production: exactly the
 * failure the fixture exists to prevent, arriving through the one gap the fixture cannot cover on
 * its own.
 *
 * This is the MINIMAL half of closing that: the names this repository reads, asserted against a
 * token, plus the fixture's version. Vendoring the fixture and running a drift job against the
 * upstream copy is a separate, larger change — deliberately not built here.
 *
 * **When either assertion fails, the fix is never to edit the expectation alone.** Read the
 * upstream fixture, work out what moved, and change the consumer — `hub-jwt.ts`, `hub-oauth.ts`,
 * `resolve.ts` — to match before touching anything below.
