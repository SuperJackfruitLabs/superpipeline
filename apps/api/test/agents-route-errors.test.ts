/**
 * An unexpected failure on the `/v1/agents` routes is a structured 500, not an escape.
 *
 * Ruling 9, parked from an earlier fix round and closed here. The only catch-all in `index.ts`
 * wrapped `/v1/boards` alone, so anything unforeseen in the agents block — a raced UNIQUE write
 * against `agents_external_pair_unique`, a malformed body, a D1 hiccup — left the Worker's
 * `fetch` handler entirely instead of becoming a response a client could read. Same write
 * safety, strictly worse failure.
 *
 * Malformed JSON is the deterministic way to reach that path: `await request.json()` throws, from
 * inside the route block, exactly where a raced constraint error would. The point is the SHAPE of
 * what comes back, not the particular trigger.
