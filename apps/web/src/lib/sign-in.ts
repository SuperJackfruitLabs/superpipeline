/**
 * What to say to somebody the sign-in flow sent home empty-handed.
 *
 * Signing in through AgentPod can succeed at the issuer and still resolve nobody here: the
 * person is authenticated, and superpipeline has no account linked to that identity. Until this
 * existed, `/hub/callback` redirected home either way, so a rejection and a misclick produced
 * the same screen — the landing page, again, with nothing on it to read.
 *
 * So the Worker names the outcome in the URL and this turns it into a sentence. See the
 * redirect in `apps/api/src/auth/hub-oauth.ts`, which writes the same two literals; they are
 * deliberately written twice rather than shared through a package, and both sides pin them in a
 * test. The cost of drift is a missing notice, which is what this file replaced.
 *
 * **Only outcomes this file knows about produce a notice.** An unrecognised value renders
 * nothing, because the alternative is showing a stranger's query string on a sign-in page.

 * not connected to — are collapsed on purpose: telling a stranger which one applied answers
 * "does an account exist at this address?" for them.
