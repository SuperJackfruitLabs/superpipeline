/**
 * The sentence a failed sign-in leaves behind.
 *
 * Signing in through AgentPod can succeed at the issuer and resolve nobody here. The Worker
 * redirects home either way; what tells the two apart is the outcome it writes into the URL
 * (`apps/api/src/auth/hub-oauth.ts`). Without it the landing page re-renders itself and a
 * rejection is indistinguishable from a misclick — which is the state this replaced.
 *
 * The literals are pinned here and on the Worker's side, because they are the contract between
 * the two and nothing in the type system connects them.
