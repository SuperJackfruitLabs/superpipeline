/**
 * Carrying authority from the browser.
 *
 * The control pair asks who may dispatch which agent, and the answer has to
 * arrive **with the act** — recorded against the card when it is queued, because
 * the agent claims it long afterwards with nobody around to ask
 * (`charter` → `decisions/2026-08-13-ecosystem-identity.md`, Decision 4).
 *
 * A kaambaan session cannot answer that: kaambaan is not the issuer. So the app
 * carries a short-lived token minted by the hub, sends it alongside its own
 * cookie, and kaambaan verifies it offline and records the `mayDispatch` it
 * carries.
 *
 * **How that token is obtained changed, because the original way never worked.**
 * It used to be one cross-site `fetch` to the hub with `credentials: 'include'`.
 * The hub's session cookie is `SameSite=Lax` on `.agentpod.dev`, and this page is
 * on `app.kaambaan.dev` — a different registrable domain — so the browser never
 * attached it, the hub answered 401, and `hubToken()` said null. Silently, and in
 * production only, since the two share an origin nowhere else. Every card queued
 * from the deployed UI carried no authority.
 *
 * Lax does permit **top-level navigation**, so the operator now *goes* to the hub
 * (`beginHubAuthorization()`) instead of the page *calling* it, and the hub sends
 * a one-time code back to kaambaan's own Worker, which spends it server-to-server
 * and holds the result. `hubToken()` then reads it same-origin. See
 * `apps/api/src/auth/hub-oauth.ts`.
 *
 * Chosen over kaambaan keeping its own grant store (kaambaan#43, option B),
 * because two grant stores is the drift
 * `decisions/2026-08-15-a-grant-names-an-agent-per-plane.md` warns about: an
 * asymmetric grant is worse than no grant, since permission starts depending on
 * which door the work arrived through.
 *
 * **Nothing here is a credential.** The token is minted by the hub from a
 * cookie this code cannot read, and it is useless to anyone who cannot already
 * authenticate as that principal.
