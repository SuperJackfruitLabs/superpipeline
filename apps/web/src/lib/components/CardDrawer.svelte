          Links (whole-branch review, Important finding) — EVERY edge this card has, in five
          groups that never share a row style, because a person could otherwise create a `relates`
          edge or an outgoing `blocks` edge through the dialogue below and never see it rendered
          anywhere: what blocks this card (enforced, ⛔), what blocked it but has since resolved,
          what this card blocks, what it merely relates to, and the advisory cross-board ones —
          each with its own "remove" control, since `removeLink` (Task 17a) had shipped with zero
          callers in this app.

          Every `{#each}` below is keyed by `edgeKey(row.remove)` — the EDGE's own identity, never
          `row.cardId`/`row.boardId` alone. See `edgeKey`'s own doc comment (`link-groups.ts`) for
          why: two edges can legitimately name the same "other card" (mutual `relates`, since
          `wouldCycle` excludes it from the cycle check), and a key that collides is not a cosmetic
          bug — Svelte 5 throws on a duplicate `{#each}` key, which fails this whole section's
          render. No test in this project can reach that failure directly (Vitest cannot import a
          `.svelte` file here), which is exactly why the reasoning has to live here, not only in a
          function nobody reading this template is forced to open.
