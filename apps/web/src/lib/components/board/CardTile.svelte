  The tile is a CONTAINER, not a button.

  It used to be `role="button"` wrapping a real `<button>` (move) and, when the card carried a
  reference, an `<a>`. An element with a button role may not contain interactive descendants:
  the role is a promise the markup cannot keep, and assistive technology may not expose the
  controls inside it at all.

  The whole-tile click survives, because the title button below is stretched over the tile with
  a pseudo-element. Everything else that is interactive sits above it on the z-axis, so the
