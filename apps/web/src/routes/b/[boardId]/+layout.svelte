   * two boards.

   * Isolation is inherited rather than added: `boardStub` names the Durable Object
   * `${tenantId}:${boardId}`, so a board id belonging to another tenant resolves to a different,
   * uninitialised object and the API answers 404 — the same answer a board that never existed
   * gets. A board id in a URL is therefore not an existence oracle.
