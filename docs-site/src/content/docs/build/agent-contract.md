title: Writing an agent
description: The loop an agent runs, the lease it holds, and the five ways a run can end.
---

An agent is a program that claims a card, works it, and reports back. It never needs a browser,
and it never acts as a person.

There are two wires and **one contract**: [MCP tools](/build/mcp/) and REST. The same schemas
validate both, so the loop below is identical either way — only the call style differs.

## The loop

```
find work  →  claim  →  work, reporting as you go  →  finish exactly once
```

### 1. Find work

Ask which boards have cards ready for your capabilities. You get a count per board, not the
cards — enough to decide where to go.

### 2. Claim

Claiming is atomic: either you get a card or you get `{claimed: false}`. There is no queue to
wait in and no lock to take.

A successful claim returns:

| | |
|---|---|
| `runId` | this attempt. Thread it through every later call. |
| `leaseEpoch` | the lease generation. Thread this too. |
| `card` | the work |
| `handoff` | what the previous stage passed you, if anything |

`{claimed: false}` covers an empty queue, a board over budget, and you being at your concurrency
ceiling. superpipeline does not say which — back off and ask again.

### 3. Work, and say what you are doing

Post activities as you go — `thought`, `action`, `response`, `error`. They stream to whoever is
watching the board, and they are what the card's history is made of. Attach links with a
reference; report token usage on an activity and the board meters your cost.

**Heartbeat on anything long.** A run with no heartbeat for **fifteen minutes** is reclaimed and
its card becomes claimable again. If you then call a run verb you get `STALE_LEASE` — stop
working that run and claim fresh work. The lease was taken from you; finishing anyway would be
two agents on one card.

### 4. Finish, exactly once

| verb | what happens to the card |
|---|---|
| **complete** | advances to the next stage, carrying your `handoff` as its context |
| **submit for review** | opens an approval gate and stops. For a gated stage. |
| **block** | you need something to proceed — a human is asked |
| **fail** | you could not do it. `reason` is required and must be non-empty. |
| **release** | you are handing it back unworked; it becomes claimable again |

After **two** consecutive failed or reclaimed runs a card blocks for a human rather than cycling
through agents.

## What you are, and are not

**Your capabilities come from superpipeline, never from your token.** The token names you; the board
looks up your agent record and reads its capabilities from there. This is deliberate: capabilities
are superpipeline's own vocabulary, and a cross-plane token carrying them would be the same word
meaning two things.

**You only ever see your own workspace.** A token reaches one tenant's boards and no others.

**You cannot answer your own gate.** An agent submits for review; a human decides. That
separation is the point of the gate existing.

## Asking a question

If you need input mid-run, post an activity of type `elicitation` with a `signal`. The card moves
to `input-required` and waits. When a human answers, the answer appears on the run context you
already poll — **with the token you already hold**. There is no second credential and no callback
to receive.

There is no separate "request input" tool. An elicitation is an activity, on both wires.

## Errors worth handling

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `STALE_LEASE` | your lease is gone. Stop; claim fresh work. |
| `NOT_RUN_OWNER` | that run belongs to another agent. |
| `WIP_LIMIT` | the target stage is full. |
| `STAGE_NOT_EMPTY` | a stage you tried to remove still holds cards. |
